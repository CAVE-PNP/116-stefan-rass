text\<open>A Turing Machine (TM) as defined by Xu et al. [2013] is a list of states.
  Each state is a pair of instructions (\<^typ>\<open>instr\<close>),
  the first one executed when a blank cell (\<^term>\<open>Bk\<close>) is read,
  the second one in case of an occupied cell (\<^term>\<open>Oc\<close>).
  A TM is thus a list of instructions, as the pairs are flattened out
  into a list with an even number of elements (see ibid. ch. 2 and eqn. (1)).
  An instruction is an \<^typ>\<open>action\<close>
  (write symbol (\<^term>\<open>W0\<close>, \<^term>\<open>W1\<close>), move head (\<^term>\<open>L\<close>, \<^term>\<open>R\<close>) or stall (\<^term>\<open>Nop\<close>))
  and a reference to the "next state" (a natural number indicated the position in the list).
  The state with number \<open>0\<close> is reserved as the halting state
  (the first state in the list has the number \<open>1\<close>).\<close>
type_synonym TM = "tprog0"


subsection\<open>Encoding TMs\<close>

\<comment> \<open>An issue of the following definitions is that the existing definition \<^term>\<open>code\<close>
  uses a naive GÃ¶del numbering scheme that includes encoding list items as prime powers,
  where each "next prime" \<^term>\<open>Np n\<close> is searched naively starting from \<^term>\<open>Pi n\<close>
  (see \<^term>\<open>godel_code'\<close>, \<^term>\<open>Pi\<close>, and \<^term>\<open>Np\<close>).\<close>

\<comment> \<open>Reminder: For binary numbers, as stated in the paper (ch. 1, p. 2),
  the "least significant bit is located at the right end".
  The recursive definitions for words result in somewhat unintuitive definitions here:
  The number 6 is 110 in binary, but as \<^typ>\<open>word\<close> it is \<^term>\<open>num.Bit0 (num.Bit1 num.One)\<close>.
  Similarly, as \<^typ>\<open>bin\<close> (synonym for \<^typ>\<open>bool list\<close>), 6 is \<^term>\<open>[False, True]\<close>.\<close>

value "nat_of_num (num.Bit0 (num.Bit1 num.One))"
value "nat_of_num (word_of_bin ([False, True]))"

text\<open>As defined in the paper (ch 4.2, p. 11f, outlined in ch. 3.1, p. 8)
  the decoding of a TM \<open>M\<close> from a binary word \<open>w\<close> includes:

  1. Exponential padding. "all but the most significant \<open>\<lceil>log(len(w))\<rceil>\<close> bits are ignored"
  2. Arbitrary-length \<open>1\<^sup>+0\<close> prefix. "from [the result] we drop all preceding 1-bits and the first 0-bit"
  3. Code description. "let \<open>\<rho>(M) \<in> \<Sigma>\<^sup>*\<close> denote a complete description of a TM M in string form".\<close>

        If it were to enforce the constraint of a correct \<open>1\<^sup>+0\<close>-prefix, this would no longer be the case.
