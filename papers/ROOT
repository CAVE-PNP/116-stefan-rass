\<comment> \<open>A development session containing imports for all CAVE-PNP branches,
  enabling seamlessly switching environments without rechecking dependencies.
  Use by adding this directory to the Isabelle ROOTS.
  See section Imports in \<^file>\<open>../max_notes/isabelle.md\<close> and \<^url>\<open>https://www.isa-afp.org/using.html\<close>.
  Note: \<^session>\<open>Universal_Turing_Machine\<close> is chosen as base session
  because it is the biggest and slowest to check.\<close>
