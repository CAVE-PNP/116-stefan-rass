text\<open>A Turing Machine (TM) as defined by @{cite xuIsabelleTM2013} is a list of states.
  Each state is a pair of instructions (\<^typ>\<open>instr\<close>),
  the first one executed when a blank cell (\<^term>\<open>Bk\<close>) is read,
  the second one in case of an occupied cell (\<^term>\<open>Oc\<close>).
  A TM is thus a list of instructions, as the pairs are flattened out
  into a list with an even number of elements (see @{cite \<open>ch.~2 and eqn.~1\<close> xuIsabelleTM2013}).
  An instruction is an \<^typ>\<open>action\<close>
  (write symbol (\<^term>\<open>WB\<close>, \<^term>\<open>WO\<close>), move head (\<^term>\<open>L\<close>, \<^term>\<open>R\<close>) or stall (\<^term>\<open>Nop\<close>))
  and a reference to the \<^emph>\<open>next state\<close> (a natural number indicated the position in the list).
  The state with number \<open>0\<close> is reserved as the halting state
  (the first state in the list has the number \<open>1\<close>).\<close>

type_synonym TM = "tprog0"


text\<open>As defined in @{cite \<open>ch.~4.2\<close> rassOwf2017} (outlined in @{cite \<open>ch.~3.1\<close> rassOwf2017})
  the decoding of a TM \<open>M\<close> from a binary word \<open>w\<close> includes:

    \<^item> Exponential padding. ``all but the most significant \<open>\<lceil>log(len(w))\<rceil>\<close> bits are ignored''
    \<^item> Arbitrary-length \<open>1\<^sup>+0\<close> prefix. ``from [the result] we drop all preceding 1-bits and the first 0-bit''
    \<^item> Code description. ``let \<open>\<rho>(M) \<in> \<Sigma>\<^sup>*\<close> denote a complete description of a TM M in string form''.

  Recall the definition of \<^typ>\<open>bin\<close> (see \<^file>\<open>Binary.thy\<close>),
  which causes the MSB to be the \<^const>\<open>last\<close> element of the list,
  which is the \<^emph>\<open>rightmost\<close> one when explicitly referring to lists in Isabelle.\<close>

subsection\<open>Code Description\<close>

text\<open>For this part, only a short description is given in @{cite \<open>ch.~3.1\<close> rassOwf2017}.

  and used as encoding by the universal TM \<^const>\<open>utm\<close> (see @{thm utm_halt_lemma2}).

  This step is also used to implement the following requirement:
  ``every string over \<open>{0, 1}\<^sup>*\<close> represents some TM (easy to assure by executing
  an invalid code as a canonic TM that instantly halts and rejects its input)''\<close>
